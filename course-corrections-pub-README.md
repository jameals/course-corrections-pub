Exploring the concept of climate-adaptive and climate-ready fisheries management through simulation.

All code for running model simulations and plotting figures is in the following .Rmd files:

• 00_run_simulations: code for defining parameters and running all the simulations used to make the main text and supplemental figures (outputs from these simulations are stored as .csv files in the "simulation output" folder)

• 01_make_maintext_figures: code for making the main text figures 

• 02_make_SM_figures: code for making the supplemental figures

The functions_README.MD provides a directory and explanation of functions used for running simulations and plotting figures (.R files of these functions are included in the "functions" folder)

The "assessment/data" folder contains groundfish stock assessment data.
